## Introduction

The StreamPOS™ Point of Sale Plugin for Medusa Stores is a powerful tool designed to seamlessly integrate StreamPOS™, our cutting-edge Point of Sale System, with Medusa stores, a popular e-commerce platform. This integration empowers businesses to extend their sales capabilities from the online world to physical retail stores, creating a unified solution for multi-channel retail.

## Key Features

### Multi-Channel Retail Integration

The StreamPOS™ Point of Sale Plugin allows businesses using the Medusa e-commerce platform to effortlessly expand into physical retail spaces. Medusa stores handle online sales, while StreamPOS™ manages in-store payment transactions, creating a unified system for multi-channel retail. This seamless integration ensures that inventory, orders, and customer data are synchronized across both online and offline sales channels, providing a consistent shopping experience.

### Stream Payment Gateway Integration

StreamPOS™ is built on the Solana blockchain and supports USDC and EURC stablecoin payments through the Stream Payment Gateway. The plugin facilitates the integration of this powerful payment gateway into Medusa stores, enabling secure and efficient transactions for both online and in-store purchases. Customers can make payments using stablecoins, providing a reliable and fast payment method that enhances the shopping experience.

### Real-Time Inventory Management

With the StreamPOS™ Point of Sale Plugin, merchants can maintain real-time visibility of their inventory. This feature ensures that product availability is updated instantly across all sales channels, preventing overselling and improving inventory accuracy. This real-time synchronization guarantees that customers can purchase products both online and in-store without encountering stock-related issues.

### Enhanced Security Measures

Security is a top priority for both StreamPOS™ and Medusa stores. The plugin combines the security features of both systems to provide a robust defense against fraud and unauthorized access. Secure payment processing and customer authentication are seamlessly integrated to protect both customers and retailers, ensuring a safe shopping environment.

### StreamID: Proof of Personhood Customer Authentication

StreamID, a customer authentication system integrated into StreamPOS™ and StreamPay™, further enhances payment security. This multi-factor authentication system, which includes biometric verification methods, ensures that customer identities are secure, and transactions are protected from fraudulent activity. This reinforces trust between customers and retailers, enhancing the overall shopping experience.

## How It Works

- **Online Sales:** Medusa stores handle online sales through the Medusa e-commerce platform, allowing customers to browse and purchase products online.

- **In-Store Sales:** StreamPOS™ manages in-store payment transactions, including contactless, cashierless, and biometric payments. Customers can choose their preferred payment method for a convenient and flexible shopping experience.

- **Real-Time Inventory Sync:** The plugin ensures that inventory data is synchronized in real-time between Medusa stores and StreamPOS™, preventing stock-related issues and providing accurate product availability information.

- **Stream Payment Gateway:** Secure payment processing is enabled through the Stream Payment Gateway, allowing customers to make payments using stablecoins such as USDC and EURC.

- **StreamID Authentication:** StreamID enhances payment security by providing efficient and secure customer authentication methods, including biometric verification.

## StreamPOS Widget Components

**Creating a StreamPOS MedusaJS Widget**

Creating a StreamPOS MedusaJS Widget involves defining React components that can be embedded into the Medusa admin interface to provide specific functionality or display information related to StreamPOS. Below are examples of StreamPOS MedusaJS Widget components that you can use as a starting point:

### StreamPOS Dashboard Widget

This widget displays an overview of StreamPOS-related information on the Medusa dashboard.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const StreamPOSDashboardWidget = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>StreamPOS Dashboard</h2>
      {/* Add content to display StreamPOS information */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default StreamPOSDashboardWidget;
```

### StreamPOS Product Widget

This widget enhances the Medusa product list by adding StreamPOS-specific features.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const StreamPOSProductListWidget = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>StreamPOS Product List</h2>
      {/* Add content to display Merchant StreamPOS list */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default StreamPOSProductListWidget;
```

### StreamPOS System Details Widget

This widget provides additional information about StreamPOS orders on the order details page.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const StreamPOSOrderDetailsWidget = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>StreamPOS System Details</h2>
      {/* Add content to display StreamPOS system details */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default StreamPOSOrderDetailsWidget;
```

### StreamPOS Configuration Widget

This widget allows administrators to configure StreamPOS settings within the Medusa admin panel.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const StreamPOSConfigurationWidget = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>StreamPOS Configuration</h2>
      {/* Add content for configuring StreamPOS */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default StreamPOSConfigurationWidget;
```

### StreamPOS Analytics Widget

This widget provides analytics and reports related to StreamPOS transactions.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

These are simplified examples of StreamPOS MedusaJS Widget components. You can extend and customize these components to suit StreamPOS-specific requirements, incorporating data fetching, event handling, and other functionality as needed.
